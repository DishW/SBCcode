## DAQversion.txt ##
<name>:<major-version>.<minor-version>

i.e., '60kg:1.0'
These version names match the headings in this file


## RunParameters.txt ##
A flat text file with one line:

run        NI_runtime   NI_basetime    svn_revision 
%s         %.3f         %.3f           %d

NI_basetime  -   NI timestamp (seconds since 0:00 UTC 1/1/1904) subtracted from all reported timestamps,
                   so that PAW users can read in the timestamps.

## DAQ30l_Setup.xml ##
XML format, this file may be loaded by DAQ30l to return settings to those identical to this run (modulo any
DAQ code changes since that run).  For detailed description of contents, see DAQ documentation.

ev              -   Event number (starts at 0)
run_type        -   Run type (0 for background, other codes indicate unique source configurations, see E-log)
trigger_main    -   Trigger code from main loop -- 3 bits, from low to high,
                      [Manual, Timeout, Auto_relaunch, EndRun]
                      Manual - The 'Manual Trigger' button in the DAQ front panel triggered the event
                      Timeout - The maximum livetime allowed for an event was reached
                      Auto-relaunch - A critical module failed and the DAQ auto-relaunched
                      EndRun - The EndRun button was clicked mid-compression, other files may not exist.
trigger_cameras -   Trigger code from cameras -- up to 16 bits, from low to high, 
                      [hCart DAQ cam0 cam1 cam2 ...]
                      hCart - Triggers originating from the hydraulic cart

                      cam# - Trigger from image diff in given camera
                    Note -- value >=4 indicates video trigger
trigger_PLC     -   Trigger code from cRIO (PLC), one bit for each trigger condition, bits are high if that trigger was the 
                      "first fault" triggering compression.  The order of bits is specified in DAQ30l_Setup.xml, but should
                      not change between runs.  The current setup (which may be considered part of the PICO2L:1.0 definition) is,
                      from low bit to high bit,
                      [DAQfast DAQslow dP1 dP5 dP4 Pdiff P1_Pset P5_Pset P4_Pset P3_max P2_min TCPIP DAQDEAD]
                      These trigger conditions correspond to:
                      DAQfast - Hardware signal from DAQ for fast compression (usually video trigger)

frame_number    -   camera generated frame number (generally the same for all cameras, 
                      but not gauranteed to be so, and not neccessarily a probly if it isn't)

## cam<n>image<nnn>.bmp ##
BMP images written by cameras.  First <n> in filename is camera number (starts at 0), second is frame number (also starts at 0).
Camera number assigned to physical camera is set by DAQ30l_Setup.xml in conjuction with MAX.

PGM can be read using imread in Matlab, and is understood by 'convert', 'display' and other ImageMagick tools, and is well
documented (e.g. in Wikipedia...)
