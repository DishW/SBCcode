##### Setting up a Python IDE #####
Download Sublime Text 3 at (make sure to get the correct distribution for your system):

http://www.sublimetext.com/3

Sublime is just a text editor, but supports file types of almost any programming language.
For Python, it is also capable of building your .py files and running them directly out of
the text editor.  This can be done in either an interactions window, or set up to run in a
new tab (if you want it to run in a new tab, contact me and I can find a time to set it up
for you).

Now that you have Sublime installed, open the editor and create a new file, under the "File"
menu in the top-left.  The file type will likely default to "Plain Text".  You can check this
in the bottom right-hand corner of the window.  In order to change this, simply click where
it says the file type, and it should bring up a menu for you.  Select Python and when you
save your file now, it should save with a .py extension.

Now to setup Sublime for running Python code.  Under the 'View' menu in the top toolbar,
select show console.  Next, copy the block of code between the asterisks into the console
and hit enter to execute it.

import urllib.request,os,hashlib; h = '2915d1851351e5ee549c20394736b442' + '8bc59f460fa1548d1514676163dafc88'; pf = 'Package Control.sublime-package'; ipp = sublime.installed_packages_path(); urllib.request.install_opener( urllib.request.build_opener( urllib.request.ProxyHandler()) ); by = urllib.request.urlopen( 'http://packagecontrol.io/' + pf.replace(' ', '%20')).read(); dh = hashlib.sha256(by).hexdigest(); print('Error validating download (got %s instead of %s), please try manual install' % (dh, h)) if dh != h else open(os.path.join( ipp, pf), 'wb' ).write(by)

You should now have the package control extension for Sublime.  Under 'Tools', open the Command
Palette and begin typing 'Install Packages' until the module is brought up and click on it.
Another text box should pop up, where you can begin to type.  Enter 'SublimeREPL', and click
on the package when it shows up to install it.

To test and make sure everything is properly installed, try executing any snippet of Python
code.  If you lack creativity, just try 'print "Hello World"'(without the single quotes).
Then, under tools, choose Build (or hit Ctrl/Cmd + B) to run your Python file.  The results
should appear in an interactions window at the bottom.

Now to install numpy, a Python library which we will be using a lot this summer.  Back in
the Command Palette, find 'Install Packages' again, open it, and then search for 'Anaconda'.
Click the package to install it.  It will open up a page with some documentation concerning
the Anaconda distribution, which you can close out of whenever you please.  You should now
have access to all scientific computing packages contained in Anaconda, including numpy.

If you have any issues, find a time to sit down with me and I can troubleshoot any problems
you are having.
